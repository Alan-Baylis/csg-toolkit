# csg-toolkit
A CSG Toolkit for Unity3D that allows building of complex meshes with simple primitives.

The goals for the csg-toolkit are mainly:
- An easy to use CSG set of operators and primitive generators that allow construction of meshes through mathematical methods.
- A language that will allow the development of complex CSG constructions.

The toolkit is based on the excellent work of others with the use of:
